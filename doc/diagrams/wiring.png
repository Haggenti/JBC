Layout structure:
1. Arduino Nano at center
2. Power rails (5V and GND) on both sides
3. Components organized by function:
   - Left side: Sensors and control (DS18B20, Encoder)
   - Right side: Displays (LCD, TM1637s)
   - Bottom: Output devices (SSR, LED, Buzzer)
4. Clear labeling of all pins and connections
5. Color coding:
   - Red: 5V power
   - Black: Ground
   - Yellow: Data/Signal
   - Blue: I2C
